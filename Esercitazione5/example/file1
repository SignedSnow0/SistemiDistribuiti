Can you explain to me how
You're so evil, how?
It's too late for me now
There's a hole in the Earth (hole in the Earth), I'm out
There's a hole in the Earth (hole in the Earth), I'm out
Can you explain to me now
If you're still able? Well
(It's time) I think you know the truth
There's a hole in the Earth (hole in the Earth), I'm out
I hate all of my friends
They all lack taste sometimes
There's a hole in the Earth (hole in the Earth), I'm out
There's a hole in the Earth (hole in the Earth)
Please, take a bow (this is the end)
Somewhere (this is the end)
Somewhere
There's a hole in the Earth (hole in the Earth)
There's a hole in the Earth (hole in the Earth)
I hate all of my friends (I'm out)
There's a hole in the Earth (I will wait)
Somewhere
